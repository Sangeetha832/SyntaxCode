Polymorphism:
-------------
    Polymorphism means many forms. A single action can  achieve many form of the method with different parameters, different return type. 
    The polymorphism achieve two methods are method overloading(compile time polymorphism) and method overriding(run time polymorphism).

1.Method Overloading(compile time polymorphism)
-----------------------
    A single class have multiple method with same name but different list of parameters, different type of parameters. 
    The complier determines method to called based on the argument passed during the method called at compile time.

2. Method Overriding(Runtime Polymorphism)
----------------------
    Method Overriding is achieve in inherited from superclass. the method in the subclass have same method and 
    signature like method name and parameters. The method is called at the runtime based on actual object type,
    if the object is referred by a superclass references.
