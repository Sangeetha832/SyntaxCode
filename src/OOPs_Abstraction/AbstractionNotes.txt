Abstraction :

	It shows only the essential things and hide the internal details. 
	For example we do not know the internal process of the phone call.
	We use abstract class and interface to achieve the abstraction.
	
Abstract class:
	It cannot be instantiated.
	The class is declared with abstract keyword is known as abstract class. 
	it contains abstract method ( without body of the method) and non-abstract method(with body of the method).
	it can have static and constructors methods also.
	it can have final method to force not to change subclass methods.
	
	- may or may not have concrete and abstract method in abstract class 
	- abstract classes enforce inheritance.
	- abstract method enforce overriding.
	
	
Interface:

	interface have abstract method, 
	default and static method (with body of the method)
	private method 
	class can have implemented multiple interfaces (like multiple inheritance via interfaces)
	can't have constructors
